\chapter*{Preface}

This is a quick guide to design and simulate electronic circuits using open source EDA tool- eSim. 
\paragraph{}

eSim is an open source EDA tool for circuit design, simulation, analysis and PCB design, developed by FOSSEE team (\url{http://fossee.in/}) under MHRD based at IIT Bombay. It is an integrated tool built using open source softwares Kicad and (\url{http://www.kicad-pcd.org}) Ngspice (\url{http://ngspice.sourcefouge.net/}). It is released under GNU GPL License. It runs on Ubuntu Linux, Windows.

\paragraph{}
This guide provides solutions to specific simulation problems using eSim. Experimental procedures are explained with screen shots. This has been prepared as a part of lab migration project supported by FOSSEE aimed at migrating the labs in educational institutions to free and open source softwares. The source code of every experiment described in this guide will be released by FOSSEE under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.
