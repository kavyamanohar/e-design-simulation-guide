\chapter*{Preface}

This is a quick guide to design and simulate electronic circuits using open source EDA tool- eSim. 
\paragraph{}

eSim is an open source EDA tool for circuit design, simulation, analysis and PCB design, developed by FOSSEE team at IIT Bombay. It is an integrated tool built using open source softwares Kicad and (\url{http://www.kicad-pcd.org}) Ngspice (\url{http://ngspice.sourcefouge.net/}). It is released under GNU GPL License. It runs on Ubuntu Linux, Windows.

\paragraph{}
This guide provides solutions to specific simulation problems using eSim. Experimental procedures are explained with screen shots. You may use eSim manual (\url{http://esim.fossee.in/resource/book/esimusermanual.pdf}) for further reference.
