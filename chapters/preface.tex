\chapter*{Preface}

This is a quick guide for designing and simulating electronic circuits using open source  EDA tool- eSim. 
\paragraph{}

eSim is an open source EDA tool for circuit design, simulation, analysis and PCB design, developed by FOSSEE team at IIT Bombay. It is an integrated tool build using open source software such as Kicad (\url{http://www.kicad-pcd.org}), Ngspice (\url{http://ngspice.sourcefouge.net/}) It is released under GNU GPL License. It runs on Ubuntu Linux, Windows XP and Windows.

\paragraph{}
This guide provides the solution to specific simulation problems using eSim assuming the readers are familar with basic the workflow of eSim. Hence new users of eSim are requested to have a read on esim usermanual (\url{http://esim.fossee.in/resource/book/esimusermanual.pdf}) before using this guide for simulation.
