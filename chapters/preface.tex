\chapter*{Preface}

This is a quick guide for designing and simulating electronic circuits using open source  EDA tool- eSim. 
\paragraph{}

eSim is an open source EDA tool for circuit design, simulation, analysis and PCB design, developed by FOSSEE team at IIT Bombay. It is an integrated tool build using open source software such as Kicad (\url{http://www.kicad-pcd.org}), Ngspice (\url{http://ngspice.sourcefouge.net/}) It is released under GNU GPL License. It runs on Ubuntu Linux, Windows XP and Windows.

\paragraph{}
This guide assumes the readers are familar with the workflow of eSim and provides the solution to specific simulation problems. Hence new users of eSim are requested to have a read on esim user manual before using this guide for simulation.
